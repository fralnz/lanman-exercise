<h2>1 Sales taxes problem</h2>
<p>This problem requires some kind of input. You are free to implement any mechanism for
    feeding input into your solution. You should provide sufficient evidence that your solution is
    complete by, as a minimum, indicating that it works correctly against the supplied test data.</p>
<h3>1.1 PROBLEM: SALES TAXES</h3>
<p>Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical
    products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported
    goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.
    When I purchase items I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price
    (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of sales taxes
    paid. The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains
    (np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.
    Write an application that prints out the receipt details for the following shopping baskets</p>
